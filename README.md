# Tryhackme Write-ups - Lab
- This is a series of Tryhackme write-ups.
- I do not recommend reading them without first trying to find the flag on the machine yourself.
- If you get stuck after thinking through the challenge on your own, I'll give you some more hints to help. And if you're still stuck, that's the time to read the write-up again, take notes, search for keywords, and learn about any technologies you don't understand.
